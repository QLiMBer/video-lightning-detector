# Sample Videos

This folder contains small sample videos used for testing and demonstrations of the video-lightning-detector.

## Contributor Workflow (sanitizing samples)
When preparing new samples, remove sensitive metadata and optionally also audio before adding files here.

1) Strip camera/GPS metadata on Windows using ExifTool:
```
"exiftool(-k).exe" -r -P -overwrite_original -ext mp4 -UserData:GPSCoordinates= -Keys:AndroidModel= -Keys:AndroidMake= -Composite:GPSLatitude= -Composite:GPSLongitude= -Composite:GPSPosition= "\path\to\videos\"
```
Note: This worked for me, you may need to modify it depending on what metadata you need to remove.


2) Remove audio track in WSL with ffmpeg (keeps video stream as-is):
```
for f in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i "$f" -c copy -an "noaudio_$f"; done
```

3) Copy the sanitized files into `resources/samples/` and reference them below.

## Guidelines
- Keep files reasonably small to avoid bloating the repo; consider short clips or downscaled resolution.

## CI Usage
- Functional assertions only: positive sample `sample_yes.mp4` must produce >0 detections; negative sample `sample_no.mp4` must produce 0 detections. CI parses detections by counting the info log line `Frame meets the threshold requirements.` while skipping frame export (`-f`).
